# Errors

A lot of things might go wrong with your HTTP Requests. <%= config[:app_name] %> API returns
[Standard HTTP Response Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to
indicate the success or failure of the request.

When the HTTP Response code is in the range `400-599`, this means that something has gone wrong.

The following are common error cases. You can see the HTTP Response Status Code and possible
causes of error:

Status Code | Explanation
------------|-----------------------------------------------------
`401`       | You have provided a non-existing or inactive API key
`422`       | When the data in the request are invalid. For example, for an SMS request, the `fromLabel` does not belong to you.
`500-599`   | Indicates an error that took place on the server side. <%= config[:app_name] %> developers are automatically notified for such errors and will immediately try to remedy this situation. If your problem persists, use the contact form on <%= config[:app_name] %> Web site to report the problem.

In case you get an error in the range `500-599`, we are suggesting that you retry your
request. Maybe with an increasing wait in-between the retries. You can retry up to a certain
amount of times before you give up.

> Structure of JSON Object in Response Body when Error:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "username": "...",
    "resultCode": "0",
    "resultDescription": "ERROR: ...",
    "clientRequestId": "...",
    "smsServerRequestId": null,
    "error": "..."
  }
}
```

The body of the HTTP Response body, might give you more information about what was the problem. If it is
not empty, it will contain a JSON object. Take a look at the `Structure of JSON Object in Response Body when Error`.
